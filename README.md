# League-of-Legends_Which-decisions-before-10min-lead-to-win-
With the data of almost 9000 League of Legends games at 10min, we will define which decisions are the best ones to increase the probability to win the game. 

As my first Data Science project, I am glad to share this one with you.
I have played League of Legends for almost 10 years now, and I have tried to bring a new point of view on this dataset. 

This dataset comes from Kaggle you can find on the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min

Hope you will enjoy my work. 

I will be glad to have your advices and comments on this notebook.

Thanks for reading !
